# emc_system

To get you up speed as soon as possible, we created a nice little installer script that will set-up your computer in no-time. It will download, install and compile all necessary software and if all goes well, you can start using our robot simulator within 30 minutes. Just do the following:

- Open a terminal (ctrl-alt-t)
- Download the install script:

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tue-robotics/emc-env/master/install.bash

And run it (Remark: This last step may not work when booting Ubuntu from an USB. Dual booting is thus recommended):

    source install.bash


That's it! The installer may ask for confirmation a few times because it has to install some programs system wide. Just enter your password, and you'll be good to go!

Head to the next tutorial to set-up your workspace.
